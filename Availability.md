**Yes, availability can be ensured to some extent**, but it depends on proper system design and the ability to handle potential failures effectively.

### **How Availability is Ensured in the Protocol:**

1. **Message Storage for Offline Users**:  
   The system includes a mechanism to store messages in the `messages` table when the recipient is offline. This ensures that messages are preserved and delivered as soon as the recipient reconnects, overcoming temporary unavailability on the user's side.

2. **SQLite ACID Compliance**:  
   SQLite adheres to ACID principles (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), guaranteeing reliable data storage even in the event of system crashes or failures.

### **Potential Limitations:**

1. **Network Issues**:  
   Availability depends on network connectivity. If users lack internet access, the system cannot guarantee real-time availability.

2. **Single Point of Failure**:  
   A SQLite-based system relies on a single server, which may become a point of failure. If the server goes down, message delivery will halt until it is restored.

3. **Overloading the Server**:  
   If the number of users exceeds the server's capacity, performance may degrade, affecting service availability.

### **Conclusion:**
By leveraging features such as message storage and ACID compliance the system can ensure high availability in most cases but not all.
