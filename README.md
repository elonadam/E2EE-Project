here to write TODOs,
this is a good video about SQLite - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byHcYRpMgI4
# TODO 1 simple GUI for auth
# TODO 2 simple func for validations with the signature they mentioned
# TODO 3 They said that the auth code was sent once, so maybe the user create pass and ill hash it
# TODO 4 Maybe to destroy login pop-up after 3 wrong entries
